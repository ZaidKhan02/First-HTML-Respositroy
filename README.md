# First-HTML-Respository
This is my first work on web development using the language HTML. In this work, I learned a lot about the essentialst of HTML like paragraph elements, heading elements, and how to create anchor tags and images. Furthermore, I learned how to create tables which helped me be able to store information in an organized manner.
